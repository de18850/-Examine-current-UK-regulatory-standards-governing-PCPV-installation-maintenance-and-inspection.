\section{Introduction}
The UK's fleet of Advanced Gas Cooled Reactors (AGR) pose a unique engineering challenge owing to their high gas outlet temperatures of up to 661 $^{\circ}$C, with a mean outlet temperature of 339 $^{\circ}$C. The vessel is a form of Pre-stressed Concrete Pressure Vessel, which should be more accurately defined as a Post-tensioned Concrete Pressure Vessel.
